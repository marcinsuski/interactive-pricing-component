## Overview
I chose this project for two reasons: to practice slider styling which I didn't have chance to do a lot before and to pracitce more javascript which is needed to control pricing offers in this project. I could go with static content but I thought it will be a good opportunity for more advanced practice.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

## My process
1. I did mobile view first. I began with html structure, using BEM to make it easier later with styling.
2. I did all the styling for mobile view. I used grid for the main part with slider as I noticed I would have to move pieces around for pc view which I couldn't do easily with flexbox.
3. after styling slider and toggle switch, I made scripts in js to control slider, toggle and style slider path appropriately.
4. In the end I styled pc view in media queries for medium and large veiwports.

### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned
I practiced slider styling and control over price offers with javascript. I feel more and more comfortable with js.
